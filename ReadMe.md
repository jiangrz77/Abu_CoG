# Basic Abundance Derivation from Curve of Growth (CoG)

This code provides **basic abundance derivation using the Curve of Growth (CoG)** method, as applied in Jiang et al. (2025).

> **Note:** Possible systematics may exist between the abundances derived with this code and those in Lind et al. (2022) due to differences in the interpolation methods employed.

## Example

A brief example is provided in:

## Citation

If you use this code, please cite:
**Jiang et al., arXiv:2510.05712**

The initial version of this code uses the **CoG grids from Lind et al. (2022)**, considering only **sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al)**.
If you use the default CoG grids, please cite:

## Future Updates

Instructions for creating your own **NLTE grids** will be provided in a future update.

If you want, I can also make an **even more concise version** optimized for GitHub that highlights usage, citation, and example in a compact style without losing clarity. Do you want me to do that?
