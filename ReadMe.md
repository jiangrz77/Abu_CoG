Basic abundance derivation from Curve of Growth (CoG). 
Possible systematics exist between the derived abundances in this code and the original paper due to the differences in the employed ineterpolating methods.

Please find a brief example in notebook/example.ipynb.

The CoG calculated by Lind et al. 2022 is used in the initial version, where only sodium, magnesium and aluminum are considered. If you use the default CoG grids, please cite:
